                    Wearable computing systems and applications have attracted interest from a broad range of interdisciplinary researchers and practitioners
                    for decades. The rapid proliferation of wearable computingâ€”from smartphones,
                    smartwatches, on-skin interfaces, implantables, and to head-mounted immersive platformsâ€”has been driven by technological advances and increasing consumer acceptance. However, despite their growing maturity, several key challenges
                    continue to hinder their adoption in long-term, real-world deployments. These include, but are not limited to, novel hardware and platform design, security and privacy concerns, effective integration of advanced machine learning
                    for on-device intelligence and context awareness, system energy and computational efficiency,
                    and improving user adherence and overall experience.
